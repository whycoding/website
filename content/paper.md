This is Haoyuan Wei, a young-face Chinese PhD students at Carleton University. 

My research interests can be divided into three parts. The first part is about machine learning. 
The second part is the error correction codes. 

Table tennis is my favourite sports and I also love to watch all kinds of sports. I can stay on CCTV5 for the whole day.
