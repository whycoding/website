## Bayes Networks


***Directed graph:*** edges have directions
***Directed acyclic graph:*** contains no directed cycle

**Define:**
>***Bayes Network*** is a DAG, G(V,E).For each vetex $v \in V$, there is a random variable $x_v$ and the joint distribution $P_{X_v}$ of the set of all random variable .

$P(X_V)=\prod_{v \in V}P(X_v|X_{Pa(v)})$

*Remark:*
There is another subtle constistency
