## Definition
* This phenomenon can be characterized as an abrupt decrease in the slope of a code's performance curve from the moderate-SNR waterfall region to the high-SNR floor region. 
* The frame error rate (FER) reduction slows down as the noise level decreases.


## Reason
The error floor has been attributed to certain sub-graphs of an LDPC code's Tanner graph induced by so-called trapping sets.

They are attributed to a particular structure in the codesâ€™ Tanner graphs, known as trapping sets, which traps the message-passing algorithms commonly used to decode LDPC codes, and prevents decoding from converging to the correct codeword.

On the other hand, the detected errors, or decoder failures, happen when the decoder is unable to converge to any codeword after the maximum decoding iterations and there are still unsatisfied parity checks. 



* Trapping set
 * Definition: A $(w, v)$ trapping set is a set of $w$ variable nodes (VNs) which induces a subgraph with $v$ odd-degree check nodes and an arbitrary number of even-degree check nodes (CNs). 
 * The combinations of bit nodes that prevent the LDPC decoder from converging to the transmitted codeword are defined as trapping sets.
* Instanton
* Pseudo-codeword

 * form a list of trapping set
 * calculating the contribution of each trapping set

* By instanton
