* If you have problem about the margin, the easies way is crop the figure by some online tools. such as https://pdfresizer.com/


* \coordinate (a) at (rnd,rnd);  \coordinate (b) at (3-rnd,3-rnd);
  \draw (a) -- (b);

* \draw[ rotate=0,decorate, decoration={brace, mirror, amplitude=2pt},xshift=-5pt]   (32,18)-- (32,0);

* \node  at (32,0) {some text};
* \node [draw,align=left,text width=4cm] at (32,0) {some text};
